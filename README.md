# 5-DOF-Robotic-Arm-ESP32
This repository contains all the files of a 5 DOF Robotic Arm made with servo motors controlled using ESP32. Forward Kinematics is achieved by controlling each servo angle using slider from smartphone through an app made using MIT App inventor. The inverse Kinematic Code will move the end effector in a vertical line.
